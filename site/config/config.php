Tinyurl Setup
---------------------------------------

KirbyCMS has built in tiny urls for every
page. Tinyurls look like this:

http://yourdomain.com/x/asd2qd1c

the /x/ in the url is needed to detect tinyurls,
you can change the x to anything else but an existing page uri.

If you don't want to use tiny urls for your site
disable them here

c::set('tinyurl.enabled', false);

/*

---------------------------------------
Cache
---------------------------------------

Enable or disable the cache.
It is enabled by default, but you
need to make sure that the site/cache
directory is writable.

You can also decide to disable/enable
either caching of the data structure
or the final html. If you are caching
the final html, make sure to clean
the cache, once you've modified your
templates. It's better to keep this
off until your site is ready for production.

Caching is switched off by default

With c::set('cache.autoupdate') you can set if
Kirby will automatically check for updates in your
content folder. Depending on the size of your site
this can slow down the performance, because the
filesystem is accessed a lot. Switch this off to
disabled autoupdating of cache files, but then you
need to make sure to delete cache files yourself after
each update.

With c::set('cache.ignore', array()); you can speficy
an array of URIs which should be skipped for caching.
If you got a search page for example you might not want
to cache each search result so you can add the URI of your
search site to the ignore array:

c::set('cache.ignore', array('search', 'some/other/uri/to/ignore'));

*/

c::set('cache', false);
c::set('cache.driver', 'apc');
c::set('cache.ignore', array('search', 'sitemap'));

---------------------------------------
Timezone Setup
---------------------------------------

You can change the default timezone used for all
date functions here. It is set to UTC by default.

Please read more about it at: http://php.net/manual/en/function.date-default-timezone-set.php

c::set('timezone', 'UTC');


/*

---------------------------------------
Troubleshooting
---------------------------------------

Kirby has a built-in troubleshooting screen
with loads of information about your setup.

It's there to help you out when things don't work
as expected. Set it to true to activate it and
go to your homepage afterwards to display it on refresh.

*/

c::set('troubleshoot', false);


/*

---------------------------------------
Debug
---------------------------------------

Set this to true to enable php errors.
Make sure to keep this disabled for your
production site, so you won't get nasty
php errors there.
